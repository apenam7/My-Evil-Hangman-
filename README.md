# My-Evil-Hangman-
Designed a console hangman game in C that cheats by maintaining a list of all the words of the entire English dictionary and continuously removing words based on the user's guess. Implemented in Linux using a manually design string data type, vector structure, and associative array implemented as an AVL tree.
